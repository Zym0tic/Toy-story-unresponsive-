         Woody and the gang go on a road trip with new toy Forky, who's convinced
         he's trash and doesn't yet understand his role in the world. Along the
         way, Woody is unexpectedly reunited with independent spirit Bo Peep and
         finds himself faced with a decision, and a future, he never imagined.

              He is a vintage cowboy doll that originally belonged to a boy named
              Andy Davis. As Andy's favorite since kindergarten, Woody served as the
              leader of Andy's toys, a position he upheld by looking out for each
              member of the group. When Andy enters adulthood and leaves for
              college, Woody is donated to a little girl named Bonnie Anderson. He
              remains with Bonnie for some time, before choosing to become an
              owner-less antique devoted to helping lost toys find owners, alongside
              his girlfriend Bo Peep.

              He is a spaceman action figure originally belonging to Andy Davis.
              Buzz was created during a time where astronauts were especially
              popular amongst children. His arrival in the original Toy Story
              created conflict with Andy's favorite toy Sheriff Woody, though this
              rivalry would eventually blossom into a lifelong friendship.

              An actual spork-turned-craft-project, Forky is pretty sure that he
              doesn’t belong in Bonnie's room. Unfortunately, every time he tries to
              get away, Woody yanks him back into an adventure he’d rather skip.
              Forky is a toy that Bonnie made out of a disposable spork, so he’s
              facing a crisis. He wants to fulfill his purpose as a spork, but now
              has a new toy purpose thrust upon him.

              Bo is the romantic interest (later girlfriend) of Woody, providing a
              calm and loving comfort whenever he is overwhelmed. She is noted for
              using her shepherdess crook to hook her cowboy and bring him closer in
              a romantic way. In private, she is a great deal more daring with her
              words and actions, which Woody seems to be quite fond of. She and her
              sheep were bought along with the lamp not too long after Molly was
              born, due to the baby being scared of the dark, which "broke every
              toy's heart", according to Woody. The lamp comforted Molly and she
              would often have her hand lay on Bo's feet.
